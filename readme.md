# Workshop. TEI put into practice

University of Basel, Research and Infrastructure Support (RISE)

## Preliminary: these materials, markdown, html

The course materials are mainly written in markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text. If you've never used the Markdown language before, you might have a look at this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) and follow this [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) (max 30 minutes; we suggest to use the English version, because the others contain translation errors). Markdown files can be read and written in any text-editor (Notepad, TextEdit, Gedit, etc.) and some of them have markdown plugins (Sublime, VSCode, etc.). Editors specific for markdown also exists, such as Typora, Abricotine, Caret and others.

The rest of the materials are XML or HTML files. HTML files, for example slides, should be opened in a browser.
